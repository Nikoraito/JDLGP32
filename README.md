# JDLGP32
Tried to add block loading from memory, debug command 0x0161XXYY


DLGP32 is another experiment in computer emulation, this time more like a machine code language/instruction set architecture, designed for the same purpose as _L3o: to emulate computers in a space sim for controlling ship systems via ingame computer systems.
