# JDLGP32
A Java instruction set architecture

DLGP32 is another experiment in computer emulation, this time more like a machine code language/instruction set architecture, designed for the same purpose as \_L3o: to emulate computers in a space sim for controlling ship systems via ingame computer systems.
